a.
SELECT count(Orders.OrderID)
FROM Shippers, Orders
WHERE Shippers.ShipperID = Orders.ShipperID AND Shippers.ShipperName = "Speedy Express";

b.
SELECT Employees.LastName
FROM
(SELECT Orders.EmployeeID, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) as TotalOrder FROM Employees NATURAL JOIN Orders GROUP BY Orders.EmployeeID) s, Employees
WHERE s.TotalOrder = (SELECT MAX(s2.TotalOrder2)
FROM (SELECT o.EmployeeID, COUNT(o.OrderID) as TotalOrder2 FROM Employees AS e NATURAL JOIN Orders as o GROUP BY o.EmployeeID) s2)
AND s.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID;

c.
SELECT Products.ProductName
FROM Orders NATURAL JOIN OrderDetails
NATURAL JOIN Products
NATURAL JOIN Customers
WHERE Customers.Country="Germany"
GROUP BY Products.ProductID
ORDER BY COUNT(Products.ProductID) DESC
LIMIT 1;

I used two different ways in calculating the extreme value such as most or least. The method I used in c is simpler but does not perform well 
when the most frequent order has more than one product corresponding to it.
